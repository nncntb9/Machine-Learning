# Machine-Learning - Achievement 1: Basics of Machine Learning for Analysts
#### This project is a compilation of exercises for Achievement 1 focused on Basics for Machine Learning for Analysts whilst using the ClimateWins case

# Description
#### This achievement focuses on enhancing machine learning skills especially optimization through supervised machine learning using python. The project uses ClimateWins climate data for European weather stations in seeking to build a machine learning model capacle of predicting extreme weather conditions.

# Projects
#### This project focuses on the history and tools for machine learning, Ethics and direction of machine learning programs, Optimization with respect to problem solving, Supervised learning algorithms, and presenting machine learning results.

# Summary
#### Preliminary results show that KNN algorithms are performing better compared to ANN algorithms. There are signs of overfitting whilst the decision tree require pruning. The KNN still requires further learning to perfect its precision in predicting weather conditions.
